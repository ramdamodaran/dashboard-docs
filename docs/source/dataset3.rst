This is an eCDF plot of US cities population based of 2014 data. This plot is interesting because one could compare the sizes of different US cities and see which cities are relatively bigger than other ones. It is interesting to see which cities are bigger than other cities in within the same state. Fo example, I was suprised to see that between SF and San Jose, SF has about 0.4 of the population. I thought that SF was a lot smaller than SJ given SJ has one of the largest populations in any city in America.
