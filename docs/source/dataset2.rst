Dataset2 
========


This is an eCDF plot of alcohol consumption in each country based of 2010 data. I find this visualization interesting because I can compare each country to see which country drinks more alcohol. It is interesting to me that some countries with relatively lower populations like Iceland drink more alcohol than USA (~0.4 to ~0.6 distribution). Also, India which has such a larger population than USA has less distribution (0.3 to 0.7). I wonder how accurate this data is.
